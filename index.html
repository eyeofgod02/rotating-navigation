                Bogdan Raczynski is a Polish-American electronic musician. Associated with the intelligent dance music (IDM) movement, Raczynski's work draws inspiration from the chaotic breakbeats of jungle and hardcore rave as well as traditional Polish music and other sources.

                Raczynski's early recordings were created using music tracker programs such as Impulse Tracker, and he participated with tracker-focused netlabels such as the Kosmic Free Music Foundation. Raczynski's post-netlabel albums were released on Rephlex Records until its closure in 2014. Rephlex founder Richard D. James cited Raczynski as an inspiration for tracks on his album drukQs. His work includes remixes of Bj√∂rk and Ulver.
